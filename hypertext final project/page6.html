<h1>Chapter 6 : The Redemption</h1>

  Max and Jake were standing in front of the judge with their lives in jeopardy, as dawn broke over the skyline of the city.
  But instead of condemnation, they were met with second chance - a chance to atone for their mistakes and start afresh. 
  With humility in their hearts, they promised to change their ways and seek atonement via moral means. 
  With the burden of their past history lifted off their backs, they greeted the new day with open arms, resolved 
  to put their criminal past behind them once and for all.
