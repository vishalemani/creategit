    <h1>Digital Reflections: Feelings in the Virtual Environment</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Vishal Emani</h2>
    <p>In a time when virtual spaces are increasingly shaping and reflecting our real-world experiences, "Digital Reflections: Feelings in the Virtual Environment" aims to investigate the complex relationship that exists between virtual environments and human emotions. A variety of net art pieces that explore the nuanced ways that online spaces shape, reflect, and alter our emotional experiences are included in this exhibition. The featured works explore the complex relationship between our inner sensations and the digital landscapes we traverse, from the loneliness of digital contemplation to the shared delight found in virtual communities. The show attempts to create a deeper understanding of how the digital age transforms our emotional worlds by combining interactive experiences, visual narrative, and conceptual art.</p>

  <p>This image shows the innate relation between a very raw human element, which is skin, and digital art. The original page, skinonskinonskin,is a correspondence between artist Auriea Harvey and musician MichaÃ«l Samyn that was sent digitally.  After meeting in 1999, the two artists started dating through the exchange of interactive Flash, text, audio, and image web pages. Harvey and Samyn first shared their "letters" only with each other, but subsequently they made them available to paying subscribers as an online artwork </p>

As a part of Miu Miu's Women's Tales series, this project has a companion film that was made possible with support from the brand. In this app, users can write their own actions or select from pre-written ones for a stand-in, like cry or hug </p>
