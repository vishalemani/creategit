  <p>RuneScape is a game that I have been playing for years together and I personally
    really enjoy embarking on different quests and missions. Through these activities,
    I come across many players and NPCs (Non Playing Characters) and I strike conversations with them. I have also
    managed to make a lot of friends through this platform and we have managed to discuss issues
    such as racism and online bullying. These issues are very prevalent in online gaming platforms
    and we have to raise awareness against this and mitigate this issue. My intervention below depicts
    a conversation with an NPC which was suprisingly very enriching and insightful. It was much more than
    what I expected and if I had more time, I would go on to interact more with other NPCs and find out what
    they have to say.
