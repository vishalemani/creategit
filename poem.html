  <h1>The Resort Guest</h1>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was in 2015, when vacationing in Batam was all the rage. I had booked a Valentine's Day staycation with my partner at a 
    pretty popular resort there, and even though the bungalow villa was way too big for the both of us, we enjoyed the privacy. But
    an experience had us re-thinking if we were really...by ourselves.
</p>
 <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See, we headed out for dinner at the resort's restaurant, which we traveled to via a buggy service. After dinner, on the way 
    back, our buggy was heading down slope towards our villa, when my boyfriend commentd that we could actually look into the
    unit's interiors from the windows. It was then that I turned and saw the back of someone's head, with long hair in a bungalow
    unit.
 </p>
 <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To our surprise, the buggy driver said that we'd reached and we realized that it was <em>our</em> unit that we saw someone inside.
 </p>
 <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, when we entered there wasan't anyone inside. We even wondered if it was the cleaner, but there was no exit other 
    than the one we entered from. Feeling a tad shaken, we pretended like we didn't see anything. But within 30 minutes, I felt
    uncomfortable and suggested staying in the bedroom for the rest of the night. Feeling so spooked, I even locked the bedroom 
    door for good measure.
 </p>
 <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we didn't talk about what we both saw until we were on the ferry back to Singapore. I shared this story with friends and some of 
    them had similar <b>uncomfortable</b> stories about this particular resort too.
