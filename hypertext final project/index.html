    12:39am, Paterson Road, Orchard, Singapore.

    Max and Jake, two inexperienced robbers, were hiding in a poorly lighted alleyway in the middle of Orchard Road, the flashy and glamorous area of central Singapore.

    They saw everything going smoothly, seeing themselves as the night's masterminds, and they were blind to the cruel twist of events that was about to happen.
